Sure! Let's provide a detailed description of the Tag Replacement Tool application and its architecture:

Tag Replacement Tool Application Description:

The Tag Replacement Tool is a desktop application designed to help users perform tag replacement in MO (Managed Object) content. Managed Objects are entities managed by a network management system in telecommunications or network domains. These MOs often contain tags that need to be replaced with specific values, and the application simplifies this process.

Application Features:

GUI Interface: The application provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the users. It uses Swing, a Java GUI toolkit, to build the UI components.

Database Integration: The application integrates with an external relational database to store and retrieve MO-related data. This database holds MO names, their content, and tag information.

Tag Replacement: The main functionality of the application is to replace tags within MO content with user-defined values. Users can select an MO from a dropdown list, view its content, and replace tags interactively.

Configurable Settings: The application loads configuration settings from a JSON file named "trtconfig.json." These settings include database credentials, table names, and other options, making the application flexible for different environments.

File Operations: The application supports saving the processed MO content to custom ".trt" files and loading data from these files for future use.

Help and About Dialogs: The application provides "Help" and "About" dialogs that display relevant information about the tool.

Application Architecture:

The Tag Replacement Tool follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

Model:

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the interaction with the database and tag replacement operations.
Key components:
TagReplacementToolModel: Manages data related to MOs, tags, and processed content. It interacts with the database to fetch and update data.
TagReplacementToolConfig: Handles loading configuration from "trtconfig.json."
View:

The View handles the user interface and presentation layer. It is responsible for displaying information to the user and capturing user inputs.
Key components:
TagReplacementToolView: Builds and manages the GUI components like combo boxes, buttons, text areas, and dialogs.
Controller:

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It facilitates communication and coordination between the two.
Key components:
TagReplacementToolController: Listens to user actions, processes user inputs, and triggers appropriate operations in the Model.
Interaction Flow:

When the application starts (TagReplacementToolApp), it initializes the Model (TagReplacementToolModel) and loads the configuration from "trtconfig.json" using TagReplacementToolConfig.

The Model establishes a connection to the external database using the database credentials from the configuration.

The Model retrieves a list of MO names from the database and populates the dropdown list in the View.

When the user selects an MO from the dropdown list and clicks the "Process" button, the Controller (TagReplacementToolController) captures the event.

The Controller communicates with the Model to fetch the MO content and extract tags from it.

The Controller then interacts with the View to display the MO content and initiate the tag replacement process.

For each tag, the Controller shows a replacement dialog (showInputDialogWithInfo) and takes the user's input for the replacement value.

The Controller updates the Model with the user's input and performs tag replacement in the MO content.

The Controller communicates with the View to display the final processed MO content in a separate window (showFinalContentWindow).

The user can copy the final processed MO content to the clipboard or save it to a custom ".trt" file.
